# STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Section 489F was added to check the menace of issuing cheques without making arrangements of funds for honouring such cheques by their bankers: However, the deterrent effect of section 489F is losing its importance where the amount payable through cheques amount is in millions of rupees. Consequently, the punishment is neither proportionate to the amount of cheque and even where there amount in millions of rupees, makers of such cheques prefer to stay in prisons instead of showing any interest in repayment of their loans or other liabilities, etc., during business transactions. Thus, it is necessary to provide more effective punishment proportionate to the amount of cheques so that section 489F should remain an effective measure to establish financial discipline and fulfillment of financial liabilities as the civil claims are not suitable remedy due to lengthy litigation subordinate judiciary level:
