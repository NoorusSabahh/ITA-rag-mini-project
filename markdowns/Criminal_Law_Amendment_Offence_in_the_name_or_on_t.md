# STATEMENT OF OBJECT AND REASON

The whole nation is suffering from the trauma of brutal terrorist attacks. Terrorism, sectarianism, and extremism have gripped the whole country and these acts have become the order of the day. The country is passing through an extraordinary situation which requires stringent measures to be taken in order to curb this menace which has infiltrated into our society. Some drastic amendments were made in the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 in the year 2013 and also in the year 2014. The Protection of Pakistan Act, 2014 was also passed after heated debates during its enforcement as an Ordinance. The sole purpose behind all this was to provide protection for the people of Pakistan and prevention of acts threatening the security of Pakistan.

In these extraordinary circumstances, the leadership of all the parliamentary parties have resolved upon taking special measures to root out the evil of terrorism from the country with an exemplary deterrence. This noble objective cannot be achieved without strengthening the criminal justice system, the Police, and the law of evidence. Thereafter, some amendments are proposed in the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (Act XIV of 1860), the Police Act, 1861, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), the Qanoon-e-Shahdat, 1984 (P.O. No. 10 of 1984), and the Protection of Pakistan Act, 2014 (X of 2014) to achieve these objectives.
