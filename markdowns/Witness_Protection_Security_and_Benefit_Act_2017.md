# STATEMENT

# STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Witnesses need to have the confidence to come forward to assist law enforcement and prosecutorial authorities. They need to be assured that they will receive support and protection from intimidation and the harm that criminal groups may seek to inflict upon them in attempts to discourage or punish them for cooperating.

Similarly, inadequate protection to the judges, dealing with the anti-terrorism cases has been identified as one of the major concerns for prosecutors. The draft Bill will ensure that the government shall implement a comprehensive program for the protection of judges, public prosecutors, witnesses, and every other person associated with the investigation or trial of the case.

# The above mentioned Bill is designed to seek the said objectives:
