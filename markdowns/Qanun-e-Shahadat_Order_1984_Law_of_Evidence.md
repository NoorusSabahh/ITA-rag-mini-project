# HANDLING THE OBJECTIONS WHILE RECORDING EVIDENCE

# Burden of Proof:

Articles 117-120 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order deal with the subject of burden of proof. It is cardinal principle of law that whosoever asserts a fact or intends to believe others about existence of a fact of execution of a document, or otherwise, burden of proof thereof rests upon him. Article 118 ibid clarifies that burden of proof in suit or proceedings on that person who would fail if no evidence at all is given on either side.

# Applicability of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order:

While taking up cases under some special laws, like Rented Premises Act 2009 wherein applicability of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order is excluded, and hence objection regarding violation of any provision of Qanun-e-Shahdad Order in such proceedings may be repelled due to such statutory provisions. However, a trial court may borrow the wisdom enshrined in Qanun-e-Shahadat Order while dealing with such matters so that principle of natural justice are not violated.

# Relevancy:

Section 2(C) defines evidence as follows:-

1. All statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses in relation to matters of fact under inquiry, such statements are called oral evidence and

(i) all documents produced for inspection of the court: such documents are called documentary evidence. As such evidence may be given about a fact in issue and not otherwise proceedings of existence or non-existence of fact in issue and of such other facts as may be declared relevant under Chapter III of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, and of no others.

# Evidence may be given regarding:

- Part of sale transaction (Article 18);
- The occasion, cause or effect of fact in issue (Article 20);
- Motive, preparation, previous or subsequent conduct in reference to any fact in issue (Article 21);
- Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts (Article 22);
- Conspiracy in reference to common design (Article 23);
- Facts inconsistent with any fact in issue or making the existence or non-existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact, highly probable or improbable (Article 24);
- Facts enabling the court to determine the amount of damages to be awarded in suit for damages (Article 25);
- Facts pertaining to right or custom (Article 26);
- Facts showing existence of state of mind or body or bodily feeling (Article 27);
- Facts to establish the act as accidental or intentional (Article 28);
- Facts to establish existence of course of business (Article 29).

A good presiding officer is always conscious of contents of issues framed in a civil suit, and of a charge in a criminal proceeding, and to keep in mind throughout the recording of evidence, and to judge every question put to a witness, and every document brought on record, on the test of relevancy vis a vis issues so framed, and charge so cast.

# Relevancy of Character:

A good presiding officer is always conscious of contents of issues framed in a civil suit, and of a charge in a criminal proceeding, and to keep in mind throughout the recording of evidence, and to judge every question put to a witness, and every document brought on record, on the test of relevancy vis a vis issues so framed, and charge so cast.

# Admissibility:

When a fact likely to be adduced as evidence through a witness, or a document, passes the test of relevancy, the court has to examine the nature of statement, or of document, on the test of admissibility. Every relevant fact may not be admissible in evidence. A document may be relevant, but in its present form, not admissible in evidence, like an unregistered sale deed, or an unattested copy of public document, or hearsay portion of a witness’s statement. Article 131 ibid requires a court to decide the question of relevancy and admissibility, whenever agitated before it.

Certified Copies of public documents are admissible only when coming up to the test of Article 87 ibid, and of a document maintained by a public officer, which may be inspected by a person as a matter of right, and is certified to be a true copy. Mere putting signatures.

# Evidence Not Required on Facts Which Are Judicially Noticeable:

Article 111 ibid requires a Court to take judicial notice of:

- All Pakistan laws,
- course of proceedings of the Legislature,
- seals of all the Courts,
- divisions of time,
- geographical divisions of the World,
- public festivals,
- notified holidays,
- names of members and officers of the Court,
- and of all advocates and other persons authorized by law to appear or act before it,
- rule of the road on land or at sea,
- and on all matters of public history, literature, science or art, for which the court may resort for its aid to appropriate books or documents of reference.

However, Court is competent not to take judicial notice of any fact, if the person inviting, is unable to produce any such book or document as it may consider necessary to enable it to do so. (Article 111).

No evidence will be admissible in any suit or proceeding to deny the truth of such fact for which any person, by his declaration, act or omission, intentionally caused or permitted the other to believe as true. (theory of estoppels, Article 114).

An official on a Photostat or just putting an ‘attested’ stamp, does not make it a certified.

# Dealing With Evidence Recording:

Article 133 required the witnesses, first, to be examined in chief, then permitted to be cross examined, and finally may be re-examined by the calling party, but it must be confined to relevant facts, though cross-examination may extend even to such relevant facts, which were not testified by witness in examination in chief. If some new matter is introduced in re-examination, with permission of Court, such witness may be further cross examined.

# Handling the Leading Questions:

Article 133 required the witnesses, first, to be examined in chief, then permitted to be cross examined, and finally may be re-examined by the calling party, but it must be confined to relevant facts, though cross-examination may extend even to such relevant facts, which were not testified by witness in examination in chief. If some new matter is introduced in re-examination, with permission of Court, such witness may be further cross examined.

# Impeaching Credit of a Witness in Cross Examination:

During cross examination, a witness may be asked any question to test his veracity, identity, position in life, or for shaking his credit, by injuring his character, though the answer may incriminate him or expose to penalty or forfeiture. (Article 141).

However, it is discretion of the Court to disallow a question so put to a witness, or to permit a witness not to answer, or to compel to answer (Article 143) but if a witness refuses to answer, despite command of the Court, inference may be drawn against him.

Moreover, while putting such questions under Article 143 ibid, there must be some reasonable ground with questioner, for thinking that the imputation so being made, is well founded. (Article 144).

The Court may forbid any question or inquiries which it regards as indecent or scandalous, although such question or inquiries may have some bearing on the questions before the court, unless they relate to facts in issue or to matters necessary to be known in order to determine whether or not the facts in issue existed. (Art. 146).

The court shall forbid any question which appears to it to be intended to insult or annoy or which though proper in itself appears to the court needlessly offensive in form. (Article 148).

A party cross examining a witness, may impeach his credit by producing persons acquainted with the witness, to prove him unworthy of credit, by producing proof of bribery against him, by producing former

# Liability of Advocates

A party cross examining a witness, may impeach his credit by producing persons acquainted with the witness, to prove him unworthy of credit, by producing proof of bribery against him, by producing former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence, by proving the prosecutrix, in a rape case, of generally immoral character. (Article 151)

# Refreshing The Memory

A witness may, while under examination refresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned or so soon afterwards that the Court considers it likely that the transaction was at the time fresh in his memory. The witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other person and read by the witness within the time aforesaid if when he read it he knew it to be correct. Such witness may, with the permission of the court, refer also to a copy of such document for refreshing the memory, and court may permit, if it is satisfied that there is sufficient reason for non production of the original. Similarly, an Expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treatise. (Article 155).

Similarly, an Expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treatise. (Article 155).

A document used for refreshing the memory may be examined by the party cross examining him. (Article 157)

Article 17 ibid requires in matters pertaining to financial or future obligations, if reduced to writing, that such instrument be attested by two men, or one man and two women, so that one may remind the other, if necessary and evidence shall be led accordingly.

# Confidentiality or Secrecy of Documents summoned to be Produced:

No person summoned to produce a document can refuse to produce the same before the Court, but if he has some objection to its production or admissibility, validity of such objection shall be decided by the Court. And the Court may, if it sees fit, inspect such document, unless it refers to matters of State. The court may also seek translation of such document, for deciding the question of relevancy or objections against production (Art. 158).

# Power Of The Judge To Put Questions:

Article 161 ibid empowers a Judge to ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts, about any fact relevant or irrelevant and may order the production of any document or things. Neither the parties, nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or order nor, without the leave of the court, to cross examine any such witness upon any answer so given to the Court.

However, a Judge cannot compel to answer a question or to ask for production of a document, which such witness may refuse to answer or produce, under Articles 4 to 14 ibid.

It may be reminded that thorough study of Qanun-i-Shahdat Order, Criminal Procedure Code and Volume III of High Court Rules and Orders, coupled with the Judgments of Hon’ble Superior Courts on the subject of evidence and procedure, is imperative to be a good lawyer or a good judge, and there is no shortcut to success.
