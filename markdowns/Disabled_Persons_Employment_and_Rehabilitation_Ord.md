# STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

In 1981, law was passed for the welfare, employment and rehabilitation of persons with disabilities which has no comprehensive legislation to cover the problems and hardships faced by the persons with disabilities. Keeping this very objective in mind, a dire need is felt at large for such legislation to formulate, assess, manage and address the problems and grievances faced by the persons with disabilities from the gross-root to top level and vice-versa. According to the Directorate General of Special Education, which was shared in one programme, out of total population of 180 million, there are 4 to 8 million persons with disabilities in Pakistan and 45% of these are children under 18. At least 3 million adults (both genders included) need rehabilitation through some kind of employment.

In 2002, the Federal Government introduced the "National Policy for the Persons with Disabilities" and funds were allocated for ten years from 2001-2011 for education, training and rehabilitation of the handicapped. Main responsibility was of the Ministry of Women Development, Social Welfare and Special Education. But, all the steps remained in the papers; the work done was only in the main cities and that also did not meet the requirements of the persons with disabilities because there was no comprehensive legislative cover upon the policies and planning.

It is unfortunate to say that during the more than last thirty years (after the law was passed), governments have not introduced any improved and comprehensive legislation in both the Houses, National Assembly and the Senate.

The object of amendments is to introduce a practical approach through the proposed system at District, Tehsil and Union Council levels for the welfare of the persons with disabilities in every sphere of life.

According to the announced policy of the Federal Government in 2002, the quota was increased to two percent (2%) by a special directive of the Prime Minister for the public and private sector to employ the persons with disabilities. But, unfortunately, reports show that special persons were deprived of their right of two percent (2%) seats in Federal departments. There were almost daily reports telecasted on TV channels and published in print media regarding the grievances of the persons with disabilities.

Details of employment of person with disabilities given in answers given in national assembly was near to nil, which is alarming: It is proposed in the bill that steps should be taken to fix Employment quota equal to the percentage of disability existing in the society for disabled persons for employment in the federal, provincial and district departments.

Just before the devolution of ministries, according to the print media details in present years the total strength of staff in fifty-five (55) Ministries and Divisions was thirty thousand four hundred ninety-six (30,496) persons; but against six thousand one hundred and ten (6,110) quota posts for special persons only two thousand and sixteen (2,016) persons with disabilities had been adjusted. Whereas there was staggering shortfall of four thousand and forty-nine (4,049) posts. Now has increased.

This Bill proposes that a new Section 2A shall be inserted after Section 2 of the Persons with disabilities (Employment and Rehabilitation) Ordinance, 1981 (XL of 1981), where fourteen facilities are to be provided on top priority basis by the government; according which the government must ensure quota of two percent (2%) for the persons with disabilities in the Federal, Provincial District Departments.

In case of any institution department ignores the quota of two percent (2%) for the persons with disabilities while giving advertisement for employment, then serious action should be taken against them.

The government will also be bound to give full concession in admission fee and ensure relief of seventy-five percent (75%) tuition fee in government educational institutions and fifty percent (50%) in private educational institutions and other financial assistance required by needy persons with disabilities and seats will be reserved at every stage of education.

It would be the duty of the Federal Government to provide the special facilities for educational admissions, registration of birth and issuing certificates, CNIC and passports at home to the persons with disabilities and Provincial; District; Tehsil and Union Council will make it convenient.

The government shall ensure to provide fifty percent (50%) concession to the persons with disabilities in PIA, Railway, public and private transport fares.

The Government shall give full relief for the persons with disabilities on import of vehicles and other items relating to disabilities.

The Government shall provide free treatment to the persons with disabilities in Federal, Provincial, District headquarters Social Security hospitals, dispensaries and in private hospitals only sixty percent (60%) charges be taken.

# 12.

The Federal government shall provide special discount of 30% to the persons with disabilities in utility stores.

# 13.

The government is also proposed to ensure provision of wheel chairs on demand from the persons with disabilities at airports, parks, railway stations and other public places. Pakistan Bait-ul-Maal and Zakat and Ushr departments will be bound to provide help on a monthly basis to the needy persons with disabilities.

# 14.

Furthermore, a sum of Rupees one hundred thousand is proposed to be given on the marriage of children of the persons with disabilities.

# 15.

The Bill demands interest-free loans up to Rupees three lakh (Rs 3,00,000) to be provided by Pakistan Bait-ul-Maal for setting up small businesses to the persons with disabilities.

# 16.

It is demanded that the Federal government shall also ensure provision of easy access to public and private facilities for the persons with disabilities.

# 17.

The Bill also seeks full access to knowledge through information technology with the help of adaptive software and hardware which have become common facilities for visually impaired, deaf and physically handicapped persons.

# 18.

While recruiting for posts such as tube-well operator, etc., complaint offices of utility departments: gas, electricity and water authority at the union council level, it is proposed that the government shall prefer the appointments of persons with disabilities according to their qualifications and conditions to handle the job.

# 19.

All persons with disabilities working on a contractual basis in any government, semi-government, or private institutions are proposed to be made permanent within a period of six months after the enactment of this Act.

# 20.

It is further proposed that the District, Tehsil and Local councils shall be established and proposed amendments given detailed functions of the said councils. The reason for proposing such amendments was to make government responsible through councils at District, Tehsil and Union Council level. Functions of the councils are as follows:

- Evaluate, assess, and coordinate the execution of federal and provincial policy at District level and have responsibility for the achievement of the purposes of this Act.
- Coordinating the survey of the persons with disabilities.
- Arranging and coordinating the medical examinations and treatment of the persons with disabilities.

Health counters shall be established in the hospitals and shall provide useful appliances and other devices for the help needed persons with disabilities. Establishment of training centers, facilities counters in every department; Arranging awareness campaign on electronic and print media about the problems faced by the persons with disabilities; and It would be the duty of the council to implement section 2A in letter and spirit. It is proposed that if any disabled person debarred from training, employment or any other relief, the authority of doing so shall give sufficient reasons and disable person can be debarred on the basis mere technicalities.

21. An addition is made in the proposed Bill that while taking cognizance of offence, complaint in writing made by the disabled person himself, under the authority of the National Council or the Provincial Council; District Council, Tehsil Council or Local Council shall be accepted by the competent court of law:

22. One important and most neglected aspect is that particular attention is not given for the salvation of the problems of women with disabilities. There is no system of government available for woman with disabilities from gross route level i.e. from school to university and on job. In the above bill it is proposed that federal and provincial and local governments will provide all facilities to the woman with disabilities through woman staff from the concerned departments of the government:

This Bill seeks to achieve the above-said objectives
