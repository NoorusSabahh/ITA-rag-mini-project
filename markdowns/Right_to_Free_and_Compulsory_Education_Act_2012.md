# STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Under Article 25-A of the Constitution, the necessary legislation has taken place in the form of the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act; 2012. In spite of that there are certain lacunas in legislation that needs to be filled according to the requirements of the said Article. It has been observed that most of the government schools have been lacking in libraries as well as proper lavatories according to the number of the students. This is also very important to specify the age limit of a child with respect to special provisions of the education and give him admission in a class appropriate for his age. At the same time it must also be the responsibility of the government to provide for the infrastructure, training of the teachers as well as ensure abolition of all kinds of discrimination against the children in schools. The proposed Bill intends to achieve the aforementioned purpose:
