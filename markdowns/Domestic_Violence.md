The Minister for Human Rights briefed the Committee that the purpose of introducing this Bill is to protect the rights of women, children, and other vulnerable persons who reside together at one place and are victims of domestic violence at the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) level. Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have already enacted respective provincial levels. Ministry of Human Rights has therefore drafted legislation to protect these rights within its territorial domain.

2. It will provide relief to victims of domestic violence who are in a domestic relationship and are related to each other by consanguinity, marriage, and kinship, etc.
3. The Bill also empowers Courts to grant interim orders, protection custody, and residence orders as well as award monetary relief to victims of violence at the expense of the respondent.
4. The Bill also envisages the creation of a Protection Committee to assist the aggrieved person and process his/her application in Court.

Members appreciated the work of the Ministry of Human Rights towards tabling this public interest legislation.

After detailed deliberations, the Committee approved the following amendments to The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection Bill, 2021):

1. In the long title after the word *children, the comma and word elders shall be omitted.
2. In the preamble, after the word Constitution, the words of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan shall be inserted.

# Statement of Objects and Reasons

The Constitution of Pakistan, through the Fundamental Rights enshrined in it, mandates the state of Pakistan to protect its citizens from unlawful deprivation of life and liberty and holds inviolable the dignity of every person. It also declares all citizens to be equal before the law and prohibits any discrimination based on sex. These rights to life, dignity, and non-discrimination are violated through acts of domestic violence, which are systematic and widespread and occur regardless of age or socio-economic status.

Besides, under UN HR Conventions ratified by the Government of Pakistan, particularly the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), states are obligated to take legislative measures for the protection of women in domestic life. Through this Act, a legal and institutional framework has been proposed for the territorial jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory so that individuals who become victims of domestic violence are provided legal protection and relief, and the perpetrators of this offence are punished. Such legislation has been made at all provincial levels.

# Statement of Objects and Reasons

The Constitution of Pakistan; through the Fundamental Rights enshrined in it, mandates the state of Pakistan to protect its citizens from unlawful deprivation of life and liberty and holds inviolable the dignity of every person: It also declares all citizens to be equal before the law and prohibits any discrimination based on sex. These rights to life, dignity and

Non-discrimination are violated through acts of domestic violence, which are systematic and widespread and occur regardless of age or socio-economic status. Besides, under UN HR Conventions ratified by the Government of Pakistan particularly Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), states are obliged to take legislative measures for protection of women in domestic life: Through this Act a legal and institutional framework has been proposed for the territorial jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory to ensure that victims of domestic violence are provided legal protection and relief and the perpetrators of this offence are punished. Such legislation has been made at the provincial level except Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
