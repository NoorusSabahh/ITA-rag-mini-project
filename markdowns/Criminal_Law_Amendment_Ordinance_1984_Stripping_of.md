Logical; emotional; sexual; and physical violence are forbidden; as are false allegations against women's chastity and honor: Prophet Muhammad said: "Only an honorable man treats women with honor and integrity: And only a mean, deceitful and dishonest man humiliates and insults women. Referring to physical abuse; he added: 'Never hit your wives, they are your partners and sincere helpers:' He exemplified this by never; ever; hitting women. The Prophet guaranteed protection of the life, honor, and property of women: Men are further reminded in the Quran: "Do not annoy women as to make their lives miserable" (Qur'an 65.6).

Women comprise nearly half of the population of Pakistan; however; they are a majorly disadvantaged segment: Gender-based violence is one of the harshest realities of our times and a pressing issue. Violence against women can best be understood when contextualized within the wider social and cultural norms underpinning Pakistani society: The root causes behind gender-based violence trace back to regressive sociocultural norms prevalent in the pre-Independence era.

Pakistan was founded on the principles of Islam, a religion that gives women their independent identity, freedom, and guarantees their rights and dignity: It is a duty fitting to ensure that women are provided the rights that Islam and our constitution provide to them. The father of the Nation, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, denounced the retrogressive customs that were deeply ingrained in the society at the time: In one of his prominent speeches, he said, 'No nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you.'

Islam strongly prohibits oppression or cruelty to any individual, group, or living being in the universe. God enjoins good conduct toward women from birth to death: Verbal; psycho.

Recent news stories, however; have been dominated with horrifying gender atrocities.

increasingly committed against women Pakistan has taken to promote the equitable

Including heinous murder crimes, honor based killings and acid attacks. In light of the above realities the Government of Pakistan stands committed in its efforts to provide safe spaces to women and girls, enable them to achieve their potential. This includes increasing women's agency and mobility within public and private spheres.

To take action against the world's most pervasive human rights violation; the Government of Pakistan through the Ministry of Planning Development and Special Initiatives, stands in solidarity with the global and national communities to promote the rights of women through the observance of the 16 Days of Activism against GBV.

As part of the Days of Activism; the MoP D&SI has compiled a citizens' guide to counter GBV to raise awareness on the issue and equip citizens particularly women to fight against it. Also, a specialized Gender Unit has been established at the Ministry to apply a gender lens to development policy and projects. This will ensure the mainstreaming of women in developmental discourse and policy making.

I am confident that these steps will live up to their intent of taking concrete measures and targeted actions to promote women empowerment and their inclusive social and economic development. I congratulate my team on the launch of the 16 Days of Activism and the steps that the Government of Pakistan is taking.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The challenge of GBV against women in Pakistan is manifold and countering this challenge requires a systematic approach and strategy: To empower women of Pakistan, ensuring their security, peace, stability, and prosperity; it is imperative that all stakeholders come together and collaboratively work together to foster a long-term vision of a welfare state that safeguards the rights of women in the country. With this in view, the Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives under the able leadership of Federal Minister, Professor Ahsan Qbal initiated The 16 Days of Activism campaign that focused on spreading awareness of pro-women laws in university campuses as well as disseminating a written guide for women to counter GBV.

# INTRODUCTION

Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) remains the most widespread and pervasive human rights violation in Pakistan. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified VAWG and has also exacerbated deep structural inequalities, reversed decades of progress on women's labor force participation, and raised the number of women living in extreme poverty, resulting in an increased burden of unpaid care and domestic work. The Government of Pakistan stands in solidarity with women, girls, and marginalized communities and has accepted its responsibility to provide leadership toward the elimination of Gender Based Violence (GBV).

Over the past two decades, the Government of Pakistan has taken positive steps to counter GBV and has showcased its commitment by introducing noteworthy reforms in legislative measures. One of the most prominent measures was the enactment of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021 to ensure quick redressal of rape and sexual abuse crimes, which mandates the establishment of Anti-Rape Crisis Cells (ARCC), Special Sexual Offences Investigation Units (SSOIU), and Special Courts for rape trials. Furthermore, the Zainab Alert, Recovery and Response Act was introduced in 2020, which facilitated effective emergency response and recovery of missing children in Pakistan. The Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act 2016 was introduced where new sections were added in the Pakistan Penal Code for the elimination of child abuse, sexual abuse, and human trafficking. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 was also enacted in the same year to prevent cybercrimes of sexual and non-sexual nature. A statutory body was also developed for the protection of women's socio-economic and political rights under the National Commission on the Status of Women Act 2012.

Moreover, the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010 was another milestone that aimed to deal with incidents of harassment in the workplace environment. The later amendment then defined harassment at the workplace in broader terms to fit the modern workplace landscape such as freelance and remote working. The aforementioned are just a few laws that have been discussed here. This booklet provides a detailed overview of similar laws aimed at the protection of the citizens of the state.

Apart from legislative steps, numerous mechanisms have also been set in place across provinces nationwide to facilitate victims of GBV, such as the establishment of gender units and women helpdesks across various police departments nationwide. Furthermore, the appointment of a woman station house officer (SHO) in each district of Punjab is another progressive step taken. Helplines have been established as additional means of support services provided to seek the support of the state. Moreover, the Government of Pakistan has also taken steps to foster digital transformation by leveraging technology to create Women Safety and Zainab Alert Applications across various provinces, providing convenience to citizens for filing and reporting GBV incidents online. Capacity-building programs have also been initiated.

been organized specifically for women police officials to upskill them to effectively handle cases of gender crimes:

However, despite these progressive developments, the conviction rate in Pakistan remains low and one of its reasons can be attributed to the lack of awareness and knowledge among citizens regarding their rights and steps they need to take in order to deal with incidents of GBV. To effectively address this challenge, a stronger state-citizen partnership is needed. Laws and mechanisms outlined in this booklet will only work when citizens are aware of them and use these to seek protection and safeguard their rights, thereby developing trust in the system.

To better inform the citizens, the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) has developed the Citizens' Guide to Counter Gender Based Violence (GBV) that enlists the relevant laws and mechanisms. The guide also includes practical advice by lawyers to effectively respond to incidents of GBV promptly across the country. The lawyers' advice section would ensure that citizens take the right steps at the right time to report and address GBV crimes without any delay, which would increase the chances of the victims receiving justice and potentially lead to the conviction of the perpetrators.

No nation can ever be worthy of its existence that cannot take its women along with the men. No struggle can ever succeed without women participating side by side with men. There are two powers in the world; one the sword and the other is the pen. There is great competition and rivalry between the law. There is a third power stronger than both; that of the women.

— Quaid-e-Azam, Muhammad Ali Jinnah

# PROTECTION AGAINST RAPE

Rape criminalised under section 375 of Pakistan Penal Code 1860 as amended by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2021. Most recently, the Anti Rape (Trial and Investigation) Act 2021 was also enacted to ensure redressal of rape and sexual abuse crimes involving women and children. The 2021 Act achieves its aim through the establishment of Anti-Rape Crisis Cells (ARCC), Special Courts, Special Prosecutors, Special Sexual Offences Investigation Units (SSOIU), Independent Support Advisers (ISAs), and a register of sex offenders. Currently, efforts are underway to ensure its implementation. Section 16 of the Anti Rape Act 2021 states that the court upon taking cognizance of a case, under this Act, shall decide the case expeditiously; preferably within four months. Moreover, the special court under this Act can only grant two adjournments during the trial of a case, out of which one adjournment shall be upon payment of costs by the person seeking adjournment.

The Anti Rape Act also introduced a new and separate offence of gang rape under section 375-A. Life imprisonment and the death penalty are the current methods of punishment for rapists and pedophile offenders under Pakistan's criminal code.

# LAWYER'S ADVICE TO VICTIMS OF RAPE CRIMES

The rape survivor should ideally avoid taking a bath or washing the clothes they were wearing at the time of the assault; as clothes may contain crucial evidence. It is important to be in the same condition until all the initial legal matters are observed.

A rape survivor should contact a confidant and/or lawyer/survivor support organizations, to bring the crime to their notice when they feel ready and/or safe to do so.

In case you are a survivor you may write a written complaint on plain paper and submit it to your local police station as soon as possible. On submission of this complaint, you will receive a computerized slip issued by the help desk at the police station; or the survivor, with a confidant (or with lawyer/support staff from survivor service organizations) can reach the nearest police station to register a formal first Information report (FIR) as early as possible.

The rape survivor should include any and all details when lodging an FIR such as the:

- a. Name
- Appearance;
- Dialect and voice of the accused;
- Date
- Place;
- Nearby landmarks and
- g. Time of the Incident:

In case the appearance of the culprit(s) was obscured and unknown; the incident as it happened and the statements of witnesses should be recorded in as much detail as possible. A signature or thumbprint will be required on the statement.

If the rape survivor is female; she may record her statement at the police station or at any other place of her choice and can also choose which investigating officer to hear her complaint:

A lady constable must be present at the time of lodging the complaint; or any female relative or friend:

After recording the statement the officer on duty should inform the complainant of their right to consult a lawyer (this can be useful if the survivor does not already have a lawyer); and the rape survivor can ask for a list of provincial bar council lawyers to represent them in court of law:

If the police refuse to lodge an FIR; the front desk/reception at the police station may register a complaint where a computerized receipt will be generated:

All legal documents and their photocopies must be kept safe.

The rape survivor can issue a complaint to the Inspector General of Police. See: https://Islamabadpolice.gov.pk/ and https://complaints.Islamabadpolice.gov.pk/

The relevant Superintendent of Police can also be requested to register a complaint:

Rape survivors can also contact the Citizens-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) if the FIR was not registered or petition the courts.

In a rape case; the police are bound to commence the investigation immediately:

In cases where the complainant is female; it is preferred that the investigation be carried out by a female officer who is at least an Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) (however as there are very few women in the police force, it is most likely that a male officer will be handling the case):

In the investigation; the complainant, their confidant(s), witnesses and any other individual who can provide important information to buffer the case should record their statements.

An immediate medical examination of the rape survivor is to be conducted in the presence of a female medical officer; and DNA samples should be secured and sent to the forensic laboratory: medico-legal report will be finalized after the assessment which includes but is not limited to X-ray reports, DNA tests, physical diagnosis etc, however; two finger test is strictly prohibited.

The concerned medical officer will then fill out Form No. 25.39 of the Police Rules and send the same to the police station along with the medico-legal report.

The rape survivor and/or witnesses may be asked to sit with an artist to create Identifying and tracking the facial composite sketch which may aid the police in suspect.

They may also be asked to Identify the suspect in parade from behind screen in order to protect their identity and safety:

The officer is required to make a memo which should also be signed by at least two witnesses.

If the accused was identified; the police must arrest them immediately; confiscate all their belongings during thorough search, and produce a memo which must be signed by at least two witnesses:

A licensed medical officer employed in a government facility will perform a thorough medical checkup of the accused; and collect DNA samples which will then be sent to forensic laboratory:

Should the investigating officer fail to conduct a satisfactory investigation; a complaint can be submitted to higher authorities for replacement; and the officer may be penalized with a fine or three years in prison:

If the accused confesses to their crime, the statement should be recorded as per law:

Following the investigation; police challan should be forwarded to the court after the submission of charge sheet, the court will initiate legal proceedings and record the evidence.

Both the parties will present their statements in court in closed hearings so as to protect the identity and privacy of the rape survivor; as well as to avoid any unnecessary trauma by putting them in the same room as their rapist(s).

Publicizing the identity of the rape survivor without their consent in a manner that defames them may also be penalized with up to three years imprisonment:

Harassing the duty officer or the prosecutor; or using other unfair means, or filing false case is also a punishable offence.

The courts are bound to announce a verdict in a rape case within four months as per the Anti Rape Act 2021.

If the accused found not guilty; they are released. If the verdict is against the accused, they will be handed down punishments per the discretion of the judge under the relevant laws.

# RIGHT TO INHERIT PROPERTY

The following national laws protect and enforce women's right to inheritance:

|West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act 1962|Protects the Inheritance of agricultural land|
|---|---|
|Land Revenue Act|All these legislations were brought about in an attempt to further empower women and to notify them of the rights they might have in property at each stage:|
|Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Act 2017|The 2011 even criminalizes depriving women from inheriting their property: It amends section 498A of Pakistan penal code and states that whoever by deceitful or illegal means deprives any woman from inheriting any movable or immovable property at the time of opening of succession shall be punished with imprisonment for either description term which may extend to ten years but not be less than five years or with fine of one million rupees or both:|

# The Enforcement of Women's Property Rights Act 2020

This Act enacted for the purpose to protect and secure the rights of ownership and possession of property owned by women; ensuring that such rights are not violated by means of.

harassment; coercion; force, or fraud: In this act; complainant means woman who fills complaint or for whom proceedings are initiated in respect of the title or possession of her property. Whereas the word 'Property' Includes any moveable and immoveable property: Further; the Pakistani law also gives the woman the right to inherit her deceased husband's property under the Amendment of section Ordinance VIII of 1961.

# In the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance: 1961 (VIII of 1961):

(C)(2) If a Muslim male from Ahl-e-Teshih dies, the share of widow in the immovable property left behind by her deceased husband shall be as follows:

- One-fourth share of the fixed price or value of the property; If there is no child left behind the deceased husband; and
- One-eighth share, If there is a child left behind:

If there are two or more widows, the share, as mentioned in sub-section (2), shall be divided equally among them.

The price or value of the property shall be the price or value existing at the time of payment and not the price or value which existed at the time of death of the husband.

Provided that if the legal heirs of the deceased do not give the widow her share in the above terms, she shall become entitled to her due share in the corpus of immovable property.

# LAWYER'S ADVICE TO WOMEN FIGHTING FOR THEIR RIGHT IN PROPERTY

Property includes real estate as well as fiscal and other assets including jewelry; vehicles; bank accounts or other investments.

Separate courses of action for inheriting fiscal assets and for inheriting tangible assets like land; and vehicles apply:

For fiscal assets like bank accounts national saving certificates etc., succession certificate has to be obtained in accordance with procedure whereas for land and vehicles etc., suit for declaration has to be filed declaring the claimant as the legal heir of the deceased for which suit for declaration will have to be filed in the civil court.

In order to proceed with filling either or (succession and/or suit for declaration) the first step is to have the CNIC of the deceased cancelled from NADRA. This will be done on basis of death certificate of the deceased: Original CNIC of the deceased will be required for such process as well as family registration certificate of the person making application for the cancellation of the CNIC of the.

(CONTINUED)

deceased showing their relationship with the deceased:

Women must have their CNICs and their existence and relationship must be reflected in the family registration certificates in NADRA records for them to be shown as legal heirs. This will enable the civil judge to require notices to be sent to all those who are reflected as next of kin of the deceased so that they have a chance to become party to the proceedings for inheritance in case they have been initiated without telling them:

The court also orders publishing of such notices and proceedings in newspapers so that public notice related to proceedings has been widely advertised. All those who feel they have a claim should remain vigilant of any such proceedings that may have been initiated; therefore, it is advisable to either mutually proceed with all legal heirs on board, or to consult a lawyer at the earliest to keep an eye on any proceedings related to the property of the deceased in courts or other competent authorities like the ombudsperson:

When the civil court will summon the next of kin/legal heirs for recording of the evidence, the women must not give any statement that shows they have given up or withdrawn their right of inheritance in favor of any other claimant unless that is what they actually desire out of their own free will:

Photocopies of all applications, documents, record of investments and assets must be maintained:

Even after court decree, the process of actually accessing the inheritance from the concerned bodies, be it banks, national savings centres, land records or other authorities will have to be initiated; they will have their own forms and requirements as well but they will also need to see the court orders and decrees that have been obtained declaring the claimants as the legal heirs.

For the legal heirs based abroad; online evidence facility may be provided in courts during the process of declaration/succession while signatures and other formalities can also be fulfilled through consulates; however, physical presence of all legal heirs would be better:

# NATIONAL GENDER POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR PAKISTAN

Gender equality and women empowerment are at the forefront of Pakistan's development agenda. This is evident through the recent launch of the NGPF that serves as a guiding document for all future efforts to meaningfully engage women and girls in the social, economic, and political spheres for transformational impact. The Government of Pakistan recognizes that harnessing the talents, human capital, and economic potential of women is essential for better development outcomes, such as inclusive growth, faster poverty reduction, and accelerated progress toward the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals. Hence, promoting gender equity is embedded in the work that the Government undertakes.

# Why Gender Mainstreaming is Important in Public Sector Management

Effective public institutions are essential to the achievement of the development goals for poverty reduction, inclusive growth, and gender equality. Public institutions and processes such as planning, budgeting, and administration are often considered gender-neutral; in reality, however, any public decision-making process is likely to have different impacts on different social and economic groups. Incorporating a gender lens in public sector planning and development will ensure that public institutions promote gender equality and do not inadvertently reinforce gender biases and disparities.

To be effective, public institutions need to be transparent and predictable, efficient in their use of resources, and inclusive and accountable to citizens. Inclusive public institutions ensure that all citizens have a voice in decisions that affect them, so that public policies, investments, and services can respond appropriately to the needs of different citizen groups.

# Gender Unit at The Ministry of Planning Development and Special Initiatives

A specialized "Gender Unit" has been established at the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives with the purpose to apply a gender lens to development policy and projects. This will ensure the mainstreaming of women in developmental discourse and policy making.

# OWN YOUR DIGITAL SPACE: EMPOWERING WOMEN TO FIGHT AGAINST BULLYING AND HARASSMENT

# (25TH NOV - 10TH DEC)

# In Collaboration with NCSW; HEC and FIA

# Background

16 days of activism marks an International worldwide commitment to end violence and discrimination against women in all forms. Although Pakistan is taking progressive steps towards addressing the problem by introducing pro-women legislation such as the Gender Policy Framework (2022), Anti-rape Investigation and Trial Ordinance, and Domestic Violence Against Women (Protection and Prevention) Act, there is still room for improvement and more interventions need to be carried out to safeguard the rights of women. One of the most pertinent issues that women face today is cyberbullying and harassment. According to the latest research report by the Digital Rights Foundation, 40% of women in Pakistan have been victims of cyberbullying in the form of sexual harassment, blackmailing, hate speech, stalking, identity theft, and physical threats.

# The Problem

According to the study on online violence, 72% of women in Pakistan are unaware of the cyber laws and how to file a complaint and seek protection from the state. More than 45% of women think that it is embarrassing to report online harassment and assume that the state won't be able to safeguard their rights.

# Our Action

As an effort of the Planning Commission to address the issue, the Young Development Fellows of MoPD&SI carried out an awareness campaign titled "Own Your Digital Space: Empowering Women to Fight Against Cyber Bullying and Harassment." The campaign was organized in 12 educational institutes of Rawalpindi and Islamabad during 25th November to 10th December, in collaboration with the Federal Investigation Authority (FIA), National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), and Higher Education Commission (HEC).

# Objectives

- Established connection and trust between the state and the youth.
- Raised awareness on GBV laws and how to mobilize support to counter GBV.

# Impact

Increased support of the youth towards the state and its initiatives.

Increased awareness on pro-women laws.

# ENGAGING BOYS AND MEN TO FIGHT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

# Our Action

We can prevent GBV and uphold the human rights of all if we make concerted effort to dismantle and transform these harmful social norms: In order to truly end violence and discrimination against women and girls, men and boys must be seen as more than part of the problem; they have to be seen as an integral part of the solution.

The Ministry of Planning Development and Special Initiatives during visits in educational institutes initiated open discussions with young boys and men regarding the spread of GBV; and sensitized them on issues of young women and how they can play the role of protectors in the society:

# STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

STOP
