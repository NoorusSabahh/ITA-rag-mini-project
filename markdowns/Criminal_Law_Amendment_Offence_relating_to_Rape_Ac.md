# OBJECTS AND STATEMENT OF REASONS

Rape is a heinous crime; an act of violence that ruins the lives of victims. In Pakistan, rape cases are reported and registered, however, the conviction rates of the accused are abysmally low. According to the reply to Senate Starred Question No.62, asked in the House on 11th December 2013, in the last five years for instance, of the 103 reported rape cases registered in the Islamabad Capital Territory, none of the culprits or accused have been convicted or brought to justice. This prevents the law from being a necessary deterrent against this criminal offence.

This bill aims to address the lacunas in the existing laws in order to improve conviction rates, and bring the culprits within the ambit of the law. Pakistan Penal and Criminal Codes and other existing laws must be strengthened in order to achieve the following objectives:

1. that the law is implemented in letter and spirit;
2. that the victims of this heinous crime are provided justice; and
3. that the criminals responsible for this offence are duly convicted.
