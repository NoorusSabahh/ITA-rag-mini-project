# 3. Committee Consideration

The Committee considered the Bill in its various meetings and held conclusive discussion in the meeting on 18th January 2021, under the chairmanship of Senator Muhammad Javed Abbasi. However, at the time of consideration of the Bill, Senator Muhammad Javed Abbasi recused himself from presiding the meeting and Senator Muhammad Ali Khan Saif occupied the Chair as acting Chairman, with the following in attendance:

- Senator Sana Jamali - Member
- Senator Zeeshan Khanzada - Member
- Senator Sirajul Haq - Member

Senator Muhammad Javed Abbasi explained the amendments in the Enforcement of Women's Property Rights Act; 2020 and deliberated that the word "preferably" used in section 6 of the Act is suggested to be omitted to make it mandatory for Ombudsman to transmit the case to the Civil Court within sixty days, if considered necessary for adjudication. The Amendment Bill further proposes that entire proceedings of the case pending before the Court ought to be completed within sixty days of its initiation or transmission and special judges are to be appointed by District Courts for the cases dealt under the Act. He also added that; if the Ombudsman or a Judge finds it appropriate, a decree regarding the rental amount for the disputed property ought to be determined and paid to the women in the beginning of the case.

The Ministry of Law and Justice argued that the Act provides procedure for summary trial for the Ombudsman to enforce women property rights. The amendment in section 6 was endorsed by the Ministry by noting that in case of any detailed enquiry or need for further evidence, the case ought to be transmitted to the Court. However, the Ministry was of the view that stipulation of sixty days' time for completion of proceedings in Civil Courts for the cases pertaining to inheritance of women was not justified as the special law cannot provide overriding provisions to the civil procedure code. The Ministry further contested determination and payment of rental of the disputed property in the beginning of the trial. It was asserted by the Ministry that the rental amount of disputed property is dealt with under the definition of mesne profit, which can only be prayed for period up to the decision of case. The Committee, however, noted that the prime objective of the Bill is welfare of women and that is what needs to be focused instead of technical modalities, which can also be addressed at a later stage.

After detailed deliberations, the Committee decided to put the Bill to vote whereupon it was passed by majority, except Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, who abstained and endorsed the opinion of Ministry of Law & Justice.

# The Committee recommends that "The Enforcement of Women Property Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2020" as introduced in the Senate may be passed by the Senate of Pakistan. The Committee also gave approval for presentation of this report to the House. Copy of the Bill is annexed.
