# Syed Murad Ali Shah

It is with much pride that I write this message for the first annual report of the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women. The establishment of this Commission is a major milestone of the Sindh government, and had the struggle of many behind it. As I was also personally invested in instating this Commission, it is heartening for me to see all that SCSW has been able to accomplish in just its first year.

The province of Sindh has the honor of being most active in pro-women legislation. The Sindh Commission on the Status of Women Act was passed in 2015 and the Commission that has been set up under it is actively pursuing the passing and amending of laws to make them women friendly, as per its mandate.

As Chief Minister, I am glad to see the documentation and publishing of the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women’s first annual report. This shows that the Commission is dedicated to work with transparency and fulfill its mandate within the ambit of the government instated laws.

It has been a highly successful year for the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women. Under the chairpersonship of Ms. Nuzhat Shirin, the Commission has been established now as an important organ of the provincial government. I wish it all the best in its mission to make Sindh 100% free of gender discrimination and violence.

# Ms. Nuzhat Shirin

As a continuation of the success of its right based approach, Sindh Government has set another milestone in the history of women-friendly Sindh through the establishment of the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women.

Selection on merit is not the pinnacle of success but brings an additional moral burden on the selected person to prove his/her self the best so we are working hard to prove ourselves. We are not just government representatives but the voice of the masses, specially of the women. Both sides are demanding for the fulfillment of the promises made in the constitution which is the guarantor of equal rights to all citizens, and we are working towards satisfying their needs.

It is almost impossible to work alone and without support. I am thankful to the Chief minister Sindh, MPAs, Women Caucus, Minster Women Development, Civil Society Organizations, Law department, Finance Department, Home Department, Department of Social Welfare, Department of Women Development, Secretary WDD Mr. Haroon Ahmad, Secretary Services Mr. Riaz Uddin Ahmad, principal Secretary to CM Mr. Sohail Rajput, DDO Mr. Qazi Abid and friends who worked continuously for the establishment of the Commission.

We would like to wholeheartedly thank all our members and Ex-officio who are supporting the Commission to keep it up to the mark. Special thanks goes to Justice Majida Rizvi, Mrs. Mahnaz Rehman, Ms. Raheema Panhwer, Ms. Farhat Parveen, Ms. Malika Khan & Mr. Nadeem Shaikh and Ex-Officio members such as Mr. Shahab Ansari, Ms. Musarat Jabeen and Mrs. Sheema Arif.

Commission is thankful to Trocaire, Australian Aid & UN Women for support.

It is necessary to say thanks to our office team Ms. Tuba Khalid, Ms. Savail Fazil, Ms. Sumbul Syed, Ms. Aaisha Saeed and Mr. Abdul Wahid. They have been working with us while their salary and other benefits are still not finalized. We are thankful for their commitment.

Support, coordination, advise, consultations, and team spirit are important tools which the Commission needs in order to be strong and effective. I hope that the Commission will progress independently and as a strong voice of women from Sindh. The Commission will support women conventionally and unconventionally. Join us in our endeavors just as our slogan states:

چلو ساتھ ہمارے  آو
کریں پاک سے تعصب صنفی کو صوبے اپنے ہم     آئو

Thank you

# Key Issues Identified the Commission

The Sindh Commission on the Status of Women aims to work towards the betterment of the life of the common woman of Sindh. To this end the Commission has a multifaceted agenda to erase gender-based discrimination, end violence, improve opportunities for the woman of Sindh to grow and nurture herself, and aid the government in the creation of a woman friendly Sindh. As per its mandate the commission will review laws and regulations regarding the key identified issues, as well as others pertaining to gender. It will monitor the capacity and performance of government departments and bodies to strengthen them by giving guidelines. This will better enable the institutions to fulfil the national and international commitments made by them. As a start, the following 5 issues have been identified as key areas worthy of the Commission’s focus:

# 1. Women & Girls Education

The commission has identified lack of quality education as a key factor behind discriminatory attitude towards women in Sindh. We also believe that gender-based violence at its roots is a symptom of an uneducated society. Education will enable women to stand for their economic, health, and political rights. As such, addressing it on an emergency basis is a priority of the Commission and it will give recommendations to improve the situation. Educational reforms and their implementation is the number one goal towards which the Commission will conduct researches, maintain databases, and lobby for greater allocation of government resources.

The situation is dire in Sindh. 24% of Sindh’s children aged between 6 and 16 are out of school; of the remaining 76%, 55% of Class-V students can’t read Class-II level Urdu text and only 24% can comprehend written English. Even more abysmal is the state of female education. Within the rural population of Sindh, the female literacy rate is just 22%.

In this context, the commission will monitor the implementation of existing legislations on education. It will report on the budget allocation and the use of that budget by public schools and government bodies responsible for improving education in the province. A few of the Commission’s key recommendations includes the improvement of school infrastructure (52% public and 40% private primary schools of rural Sindh still do not have functional washrooms; 41% government primary schools and 33% private primary schools do not have boundary walls); the encouragement of qualified female teachers to teach in underdeveloped areas for which hostels needs to be developed and maintained; increase in budget allocated towards female education; and close monitoring of the usage of budget allocated by the provincial government.

# 2. Women’s Health

The Commission has made women’s health a priority because of the high maternal death rates, among other factors. In Sindh, 1 in every 700 births results in a death. This is much lower than the 2013 rate of 1 death in every 360 births, but it is still high enough to be a cause of alarm for the government. Reproductive rights are not in the picture and child marriages make births even more difficult and dangerous. Lack of on par health facilities results in complications in obstetrical issues. Women neglect their health and patriarchal oppression exacerbates the problem.

It is the belief of the Commission that a strong and healthy woman is the key to a strong and healthy family. Good health facilities are needed to ensure quality healthcare for the women of Sindh.

second tandem is awareness regarding the importance of women’s health. The Commission aims to spread awareness so that female health becomes a priority for the families in Sindh. This will enable the women of Sindh to demand better healthcare. Having the support of their menfolk will greatly increase the chances of them reaching health care clinics. It is also our contention that gender-based violence will also decrease if women become strong in and of themselves. It will greatly improve their lifestyle, enable them to make better decisions for themselves, and stand up to violence.

The Commission will closely monitor the Basic Health Units and other health facilities set up by the government. This is necessary in order to check that the allocated budget and existing infrastructure is being used efficiently. Governmental legislation already exists regarding the provision of healthcare to women, but implementation is lacking. Redressed mechanisms for this will be formulated by the Commission. It plans on identifying areas of weaknesses and suggesting guidelines for improvement.

# Economic Empowerment of Women

Poverty is debilitating the province of Sindh as of now. In this regard, female poverty and economic dependence has sustained many other social ills such as gender-based violence. This is a direct correlation as economically dependent women are forced to bear with physical and mental abuse at the hands of their bread earning men. The state of Pakistan does not put up with such injustices and its Constitution grants full protection to every citizen’s life and liberty, irrespective of gender. As such the Commission will aid the government by examining the status of labor laws and skill centers.

Government departments dedicated to economic empowerment of women will be examined in order to identify weaknesses and get their issues across to the relevant departments. This will help to bring about more informed redress mechanisms and improve the economic status of women. Certain issues such as minimum wage labor, abuse of labor laws, and injustice in inheritance have cropped up in our preliminary research. The commission recommends that issue-based policies should be employed so that contextualized solutions can be found. An economically strong woman strengthens her country’s economy and gives rise to confident young women. Economic empowerment leads to social empowerment and increases women’s self-esteem. The commission aims to work in collaboration with government programs such as the Women Entrepreneurship Training Project, and non-governmental initiatives to provide backend research, solution oriented guidance, and institutional support and advice.

# Political Participation

The commission deems it of the utmost importance that the women of Sindh become visible members of the political landscape. This is imperative as by making themselves a part of the political decision making, women will learn more about female as well as larger national and international issues. With this exposure will come awareness of policy making, the work involved to bring about a change, and a conscience of female empowerment.

The Commission is committed to increasing political participation by women in Sindh. An aware and politically active woman is strong and can work against violence directed both towards herself and towards other women. The Commission plans on working together with the Women's Parliamentary Caucus and other bodies such as Strengthening Participatory Organization (SPO), Aurat foundation, Shirkatgah and others to increase political participation of women in Sindh. It will research whether any amendments need to be made in the Political Parties Act and

# Violence Against Women

Gender based violence is a grave issue plaguing Sindh. Domestic abuse is horrifyingly common and due to economic and social factors most cases do not even get reported. The Commission thinks it is a priority that awareness must be created, the law must be implemented, and gender based violence must be discouraged and acted against strongly by the state. Laws already exist but their implementation is shaky. This is why strong monitoring is needed so that the Constitutional promises made to the women of Sindh may be fulfilled.

The Commission will follow through with awareness raising campaigns through the media, public services notices, and official documents. Budgetary allocations will also be checked up by the Commission as will the grievances of the department working towards reducing violence against women. Strong research and maintenance of a database of cases will greatly aid the governmental system to eradicate gender based violence from Sindh. Safe houses such as dar ul Amaan will be visited and monitored. Guidelines will be presented to governmental bodies so that efficient implementation of laws for the protection against harassment, honor killing, discrimination etc. can be achieved.

The Commission will work on these issues on priority by monitoring of the existing laws, review of the laws and recommendation through effective redress mechanism. The main obstacle for the empowerment of women are:

- Different types of Violence against women and honor killing
- Health and Reproductive rights not in reach
- Education
- Empowerment in Political participation
- Economic dependency (minimum wages, unskilled workers) etc.

# Action Plan of Commission

The commission will establish an advisory committee which consist of experts of different field of women related issues and perspectives. The members of commission will be part of committees and work in supervision of advisory committee. All of them with consultation and advices will finalize the action plan for the smooth running.

# Monitoring

Commission is designing a monitoring mechanism for strengthening the policies, implementation of laws in government and non-governmental institutions such as:

- Monthly inspections of police stations and other relevant departments
- Consolidated database for tracking and helpline
- Development of Reports
- others

# Preventive Mechanism

LAW REVIEW

# LAW REVIEW

Chapter III, Section 12 (b) of the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women Act 2015, states that the Commission shall “review all Provincial laws, rules and regulations prejudicial to the legitimate interest and rights of women and suggest accordingly in term of replacement, amendment, addition or legislation afresh essentially needed to eliminate discrimination, safeguard and promote the interest of women and achieve gender equality before law in accordance with the Constitution and obligations under international covenants and commitments”. Under this mandate, the Commission has reviewed and proposed amendments to the following laws:

1. The Divorce Act No. IV of 1869
2. The Christian Marriage Act, 1872
3. Sindh Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act, 2016
4. Sindh Registration of Dowry Act, 2017
5. The Sindh Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2018
6. The Sindh Home Based Workers Act, 2018 (ongoing)
7. The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2013 (ongoing)

# Mechanism

In the beginning, the Commission had to write letters and ask for proposed bills to be sent to our office so that we can review it. Now, however, we have been established as a significant and relevant entity in the legislative process, so the law department and other relevant bodies send copies of proposed bills to the Sindh Commission without prompting required from us.

The Sindh Commission on the Status of Women has developed a mechanism whereby it deals with all legislation that is forwarded to it by the relevant departments for reviewing through a gender lens. The Commission has established committees of relevant members and civil society activists for dealing with particular issues. First, we hold a larger consultation with the law committee of the SCSW and relevant stakeholders, such as lawyers who fought cases of survivors of acid attack for reviewing the Acid Crime Prevention Bill. Keeping the minutes of the consultation in mind, we then hold smaller discussions with our legal experts who advise us on how to incorporate the recommendations from the consultation into the law. The Commission then incorporates the amendments as per the directions of its legal experts such as Justice Majida Razvi and Justice Shaiq Usmani, into the law and forwards the amended bill/Act to the relevant department.

The Commission has used this mechanism for effectively improving legislation in Sindh for a year now as it has proved to be the most thorough and efficient practice. The Commission plans on also holding consultations to review and make rules for the Anti-street Harassment Bill 2018 and push for legislation in Sindh for a Bill of Rights and Protection for Transgenders.

# INCREASING POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN SINDH

The Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW), Government of Sindh was established as an autonomous body under the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women Act (2015). Under Chapter III, section 12 (i), the SCSW has the power to lobby and advocate for increased political participation of women and catalyze the building of networks that enable women to participate in

The political life of the country. In accordance with its mandate, the Commission took several steps to bolster the political participation of women in Sindh, specially in light of the General Elections 2018.

The Commission organized meetings with women candidates who were contesting on general seats.

On 10th July 2018, a meeting was held with female candidates from minority communities who were contesting on general seats in Sindh to discuss the challenges that they were facing, their motivation for contesting and how they were running their campaigns. Civil Society was also invited to facilitate the building of networks between them and female political actors. Inter-faith Harmony forum supported the SCSW in reaching out to these independent candidates from minority communities in Karachi, Thar, and Umerkot.

Another large-scale awareness raising dialogue was organized with the support of UN Women on 13th July in Hotel Marriott with women candidates from all political parties and independent female candidates. The women candidates were given information regarding ECP mandate to make elections more inclusive, their rights as candidates, as well as data from FAFEN. Ms Mahnaz Rahman gave a historical overview of political participation of women in Pakistan in a well-researched speech, which was highly appreciated. In the panel that followed, the women candidates shared the electoral violence they face while contesting in Sindh. It was a fruitful dialogue with women candidates from all parties coming together to discuss women’s rights. It was an important event as through it the Commission iterated to the women candidates that as parliamentarians, they must be flag bearers of women’s rights in the assembly. It was gut-wrenching to hear the level of violence women candidates face at every stage of contesting for elections, but the event highlighted the importance of raising women’s issues irrespective of party politics.

Over the last three decades, a global movement of nonpartisan citizen election monitoring has collectively mobilized millions of citizens around the world to participate in their countries' democratic processes as election observers. Citizen election observation helps ensure electoral integrity, and strengthens civil society's capacity to promote citizen participation, engage in policy advocacy and foster governmental accountability within and well beyond the election cycle. Government of Pakistan welcomes election observation. In these elections as well, many organizations served as non-partisan observers. Sindh Commission on the Status of Women also felt the need to do its part and observe the elections from a gender lens.

In accordance with its mandate, the Commission arranged for the observation of the election process of General Elections 2018. The observation took place in two phases. First observation took place before the day of the polling. In the pre-polling phase, corner meetings, election posters, speeches, and training sessions were observed. A record was also maintained of the women candidates who contested in the general elections. The second phase was observation done on the day of the voting. Members and staff of the SCSW along with the chairperson visited different polling stations and observed the voter turnout of women, facilitation provided to women at polling stations, and the general process of voting.

The chairperson and members of the Commission visited the provincial election commissioner for Sindh, Yusuf Khan Khatak to suggest appointment of a focal person to deal with issues faced by women in the General Elections 2018. The Chairperson also stressed that the political parties must follow the 5% quota on general seats for women in addition to giving tickets for the reserved seats to women who are politically active and involved in the problems of the woman in Sindh. Mr. Khatak agreed with the assertations of the chairperson and assured her and the members of the Commission that the Election Commission will follow through on the advice of the Sindh.

# Commission on the Status of Women

He also appointed a focal person to facilitate the participation of women in the General Elections 2018.

The Commission issued several press releases to urge women to participate in the General Elections, and to highlight the problems that women faced as observed by the Commission.

The Commission organized a luncheon to welcome and honor all women who entered the parliament in Sindh in 2018. It was the first reception given to honor the women parliamentarians and provided an opportunity for parliamentarians from all parties to mingle and network in an informal environment. The mandate of the Commission was introduced to the parliamentarians. The Luncheon served to build a network for the Commission to lobby more effectively for pro-women legislation in Sindh. Minister WDD. Honorable minister Ms. Shehla Raza also took part in honoring and welcoming the women parliamentarians at the luncheon.

# CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT

It is the mandate of the Commission under chapter III Section 12 (d) to develop and maintain interaction and dialogue with nongovernmental organizations, experts and individuals in society and an active association with similar commissions and institutions in other provinces for collaboration and action to achieve gender equality in the province.

The Commission nurtured a strong alliance with international non-governmental organizations including Trocaire, Australian Aid, UN Women, GIZ, UNFPA, and Heinrich Boll. Through its networking, the Commission obtained facilitation to strengthen the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women from these gracious agencies.

Trocaire, Australian Aid supported the Commission by providing necessary resources for the office to operationalize including cutlery, ACs, furniture and other amenities, a car and chauffeur to conduct monitoring visits and office business, and two months salaries for two staff members of the Commission.

UN Women provided logistical support to SCSW for organizing a Dialogue on Political Participation and Electoral Violence in General Elections 2018, and 16 days activism seminar. It also hired an expert consultant to develop the Strategic Plan of SCSW with consultative process of all stakeholders. The Commission has also obtained UN Women’s support for conducting gender sensitization trainings of Nikah Registrars all over Sindh to increase their legal literacy for implementation of pro-women legislation such as the Early Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013.

GIZ has hired a consultant for SCSW for preparing a paper on safehouses with redressal mechanism to draft the Commission’s stance on safehouses in Sindh based on research and consultations organized by the Commission.

The Commission also fostered strong ties with Pakistan based NGOs for institutional strengthening of the Commission, especially in light of the teething problems faced by SCSW in its first year.

SPO has been a major supporter of SCSW in this regard. It held orientation sessions of SCSW with civil society and relevant government departments in Karachi and in Hyderabad. The first newsletter of SCSW has been published by SPO and it has also printed booklets of the Commission’s Act and translated versions of the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women Act (2015) along with important pro-women legislations such as the Early Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013. SPO also provided logistical support for a consultation with DCs from all over Sindh on safehouses.

The Sindh Commission on the Status of Women also linked itself to the Sindh Agricultural Forestry Workers & Coordinating Organization (SAFWCO). As an old and well-established organization for the vulnerable persons in Sindh, SAFWCO was an important link. SAFWCO organized an orientation of Sindh Commission on the Status of Women with civil society in Hyderabad which helped SCSW in building linkages with networks of lawyers, activists, and government officials in Hyderabad division.

Consultations on law and other issues are held with relevant legal and gender experts from civil society. SCSW holds regular meetings with Civil Society officials from many organisations such as Aurat Foundation, Heinrich Boll, EVAW/G Alliance, Individual Land, Khwendo Kor, Legal Rights Forum, Justice Helpline, NOWCommunities, HANDS, Childs Rights Movements, Inter-faith Peace & Harmony Forum, Handicapped International, Legal Aid Society, Collective for Social Science Research as well as universities such as SZABIST, IBA Karachi, Habib University, and AKU.

# Review of Sindh Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act (2016)

Date: 7th May 2018

# Recommendations:

# Recommendations for Acid Crimes

1. There should be an ATC trial for acid crimes. This can be made a part of the schedule instead of the law to allow flexibility. The clause of “speedy trial” may be added to improve efficiency.
2. Penalty should be increased to that of rs.2.5 million
3. Imprisonment must be extended to a life sentence at least.
4. Corrosive substances should include battery water as it doesn’t come under the ambit of defined substances. According to the representative of Shirkat Gah, most crimes are done using battery acid and the defense uses this loophole to save perpetrators from being persecuted.
5. The concept of rehabilitation should be elaborated. E.g. is plastic surgery included?
6. There should not be a limit on the amount of expenses the state can release per victim
7. This should be made an unbailable crime
8. This bill should be abridged to make it more effective and efficient.

# A Dialogue on Political Participation of Women and Electoral Violence

Date: 13th July, 2018

# Recommendations:

1. Voters should be educated to make informed decisions and to eradicate biases towards minority and female candidates.
2. Election should be free of such biases and candidates must be judged on the basis of their character, motivations, and political prowess.
3. ECP must give some financial leeway to independent candidates as they find it very difficult to pay for the nomination papers fee as well as other campaign expenses.
4. Political parties must be incentivised and pressurised to support the election campaigns of their female candidates so that they have a better chance of entering the parliament.
5. Media must give equal coverage to female candidates as it does to male candidates.
6. Candidates are not well informed of their own rights. Political parties should try to disseminate literature that educates the public about the rights of a political candidate and the facilities provided to women and other disenfranchised members who want to contest elections. This will encourage women to participate in elections.

# Observation of General Elections 2018

Date & Time: pre-poll, and election Day: 25th July 2018, 7 am – 8 pm

# Recommendations:

1. Political parties must be incentivized and pressurized to support the election campaigns of their female candidates so that they have a better chance of entering the parliament.
2. Political parties need to strengthen their women’s wings and make them more organized and active. This includes educating their female candidates about the election campaign processes so that they are more politically savvy and able to run successful election campaigns and improve their chances of reaching the assemblies.

# 3. Political parties do not have substantial voters education programs.

This needs to be rectified and political parties must be more active in this.

# 4. Candidates are not well informed of their own rights.

Political parties should try to disseminate literature that educates the public about the rights of a political candidate and the facilities provided to women and other disenfranchised members who want to contest elections. This will encourage women to participate in elections.

# 5. Female polling agents need to be trained better

as in these elections most were not able to participate as strong agents of the election process.

# 6. ECP must give some financial leeway to independent candidates

as they find it very difficult to pay for the nomination papers fee as well as other campaign expenses.

# 7. Female Presiding Officers must also be appointed for female polling stations.

# 8. Media must give equal coverage to female candidates as it does to male candidates.

# Visit to Nawabshah, for Case of Harassment in Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University of Ms. Farzana Jamali

Date: 9th September 2018

Complaint Cell WDD Nawabshah; Shaheed Benazir University; Police Station; Home of the affected person, Farzana.

# Recommendations

1. There is a severe lack of awareness regarding law. The family did not know about anti-harassment laws such as Workplace Harassment Act. People also did not know about ombudsperson who are available in every district in Sindh where complaints can be registered regarding harassment cases if they are not resolved by the anti-harassment committee in university.
2. The university staff such as the Vice Chancellor was not aware of the legal obligations under the anti-harassment law such as displaying Code of Conduct in all notice board and other such places. He also did not know that accused person should be suspended until anti-harassment committee has completed its investigation and reached a conclusion.
3. Media should be more responsible when reporting such cases. It needs to play a positive role. Government needs to admonish media persons who are using such cases just to sell their papers and becoming a tool for people who want to sabotage the education of girls.
4. We are afraid that Farzana’s life might be in danger. When we went to meet her, her family had her locked up and did not let us see her. Her father also said things like he is very ashamed now because of this case. They were being very negative and also said that no other girl from their family will study.
5. Right now, we need active ombudspersons to be appointed for implementation of Workplace Harassment Act. Sensitized persons should be appointed in offices all over Sindh.

# Consultative Meeting on Safehouses with District Administration & other Stakeholders

Rights of the admitted person availing the facility of safehouses, role of police, role of Women development and social welfare department, and security.

# 2. Structure of Safehouses

Structure of safehouses are not defined. Those who are held responsible i.e. the district authority are themselves unclear on the mechanisms. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing simple and clear mechanisms for the working of safehouses in Sindh.

# 3. Defining the Ownership of Safehouses

Defining the ownership of safehouses. The district administration including commissioners and DCs expressed concern over the ambiguity in terms of ownership. Parallels were seen between the controlling authority of safehouses and Committees set up against under age marriages in that both lack ownership by a government department.

# 4. Authority Over Safehouses

It was also discussed that safehouses are currently under Social Welfare Department but since the affected persons in Sindh are mostly women suffering from Gender Based Violence, therefore the Women Development Department needs to have controlling authority over safehouses and women shelter homes. This transfer of authority also needs to be discussed and mechanism needs to be developed for that.

# 5. Mapping Existing Shelter Homes

There is a need for mapping out the existing shelter homes available. For this there is a need for surveys to take place.

# 6. Transparency Issues

Transparency was a key issue. This concern was expressed from both government and civil society officials that the running of safehouses must be on a transparent basis so that responsible budgetary allocation and use of resources takes place such that the woman of Sindh benefits from it.

# 7. Awareness Among Women

There is a severe lack of awareness in women who need access to safehouses. Publications need to be disseminated and public service messages need to be run on all media especially in remote locations of Sindh which have high rates of gender-based violence. Civil society such as HANDS offered to use its district offices to disseminate the awareness raising literature.

# 8. Communication Barriers

There is a problem in communication due to language gap. Notices regarding safehouses and their boards are posted in English and messages are also not in regional languages. It was therefore suggested that messages and literature on raising awareness regarding safehouses should be in Sindhi and Urdu and other local languages so that the common woman of Sindh has access to knowledge regarding services available to her.
